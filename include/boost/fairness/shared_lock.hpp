	/**
	 * @brief The class shared_lock is a general-purpose shared mutex ownership wrapper allowing deferred locking, timed locking and transfer of lock ownership. Locking a shared_lock locks the associated shared mutex in shared mode (to lock it in exclusive mode, [std::unique_lock](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/thread/unique_lock) can be used).
	 * \n 
	 * The shared_lock class is movable, but not copyable â€“ it meets the requirements of [MoveConstructible](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/named_req/MoveConstructible) and [MoveAssignable](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/named_req/MoveAssignable) but not of [CopyConstructible](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/named_req/CopyConstructible) or [CopyAssignable](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/named_req/CopyAssignable).
	 * \n 
	 * shared_lock meets the [Lockable](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/named_req/Lockable) requirements. If Lockable meets the [SharedTimedLockable](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/named_req/SharedTimedLockable) requirements, shared_lock also meets [TimedLockable](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/named_req/TimedLockable) requirements.
	 * \n 
	 * In order to wait in a shared mutex in shared ownership mode, [std::condition_variable_any](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/thread/condition_variable_any) can be used ([std::condition_variable](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/thread/condition_variable) requires [std::unique_lock](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/thread/unique_lock) and so can only wait in unique ownership mode).
	 * @tparam Lockable : the type of the shared mutex to lock. The type must meet the [SharedLockable](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/named_req/SharedLockable) requirements.
